## ⚠️ Where the Data Falls Short

| Concern                            | Details                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📉 **Sample Size is Bare Minimum** | While statistically valid, a sample size of 30 is still **limited**. Larger samples would provide more robust insights.                            |
| 🙈 **Limited Demographics**        | Lack of demographic detail (e.g. age, gender, disability status) makes it hard to **generalize** to broader populations.                           |
| 🧩 **Manual Submission Risks**     | Manual exports introduce potential for **data corruption**, **omission**, **variability in device models**, and **user misunderstandings**, leading to misreporting during export

To begin the analysis, we load all the required R packages in https://github.com/julielaursen/r-fitbit-data. These package are used for data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and time/date processing. 

### Packages used in this project:
- `tidyverse`: a colletion of R packages for data science, including:
  - `dplyr`: For data wrangling and transformation
  - `ggplot2`: For visualizing trends and patterns
  - `readr`: For reading data files
  - `tidyr`: For reshaping and cleaning data
  - `tibble, stringr, forcats, purrr`: Support functions for tidy data workflows
- `here, skimmer, and janitor`: for simplifying data cleaning tasks

To install the tidyverse package:
  `install.packages("tidyverse")`

To load the tidyverse package: 
  `library(tidyverse)`

Then we read the data, changing each csv file into a data frame that we can execute commands against.

```r
daily_activity <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
heartrate_seconds_merged <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
minute_calories_narrow <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv")
Minute_intensities_narrow <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv")
minute_METS_narrow <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
minute_sleep <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteSleep_merged.csv")
minute_steps_narrow <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv")
weight_log_info <- read_csv("mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")

```

#### How is the data organized?

The data is organized in two different folders, one for the period of 3/12/16-4/11/16 and one for 4/12/16-5/12/16. They have the same columns in the same formats. The data for daily_activity is in wide format becuase it's a time series and wide format is best with time-series plots per metric. I initially re-organized the data by combining each individual csv into a combined dataframe, confirming that there was no duplication. However on analysis of the data, it seems the data from folder1 may be incomplete. The range of dates often stop at 4/9 which would leave a noticeable 3 day gap between the two data collections. There are also a different number of users in the dataset. For example, 35 users recorded daily activity in the first data set and only 3 in the second dataset. It seems that the user with ID `2891001357` and ID `6391747486` may have dropped out of the study between the first and second dataset. Therefore, we are only focusing on the second dataset as it is more complete.
  
#### How does it help you answer your question?

#### Are there any problems with the data?

Yes, the summary of the dataset from the project states that there are 30 total users in the dataset. However, there are 33 people tracking their daily activity and the people who are tracking their activity are not also consistently tracking other metrics. Heartrate seconds, minutes slept, and weightlog are being tracked by less than the statistically significiant amount of people to form a valid sample. For this reason, we are eliminating some data such as weight tracking from our analysis.

```r
> n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(hourly_calories$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(heartrate_seconds$Id)
[1] 14
> n_distinct(hourly_intensities$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(hourly_steps$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(minute_calories_narrow$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(minute_intensities_narrow$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(minute_sleep$Id)
[1] 24
> n_distinct(minute_steps_narrow$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(weightlog_info$Id)
[1] 8
```

## 2. Prepare

I began cleaning the data with several goals in mind. I wanted to eliminate duplication. I wanted to ensure that the column names, type and format for date are consistent across tables.

In minute_sleep there were 543 duplicate rows:
```r
> nrow(minute_sleep[duplicated(minute_sleep),])
[1] 543
```

I then confirmed this by removing duplicates and comparing the rows before and after to ensure they equaled 543

```r
> nrow(minute_sleep)
[1] 188521
> minute_sleep_clean <- minute_sleep %>% distinct()
> nrow(minute_sleep_clean)
[1] 187978
```

Dates were also inconsistent across tables. Before analysis, I also needed to conert these dates in date or character format to *date time* format and then split them to date and time separately.

| Table                       | Date/Time Column | **Current Type** | **Needed Type** | Granularity |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `daily_activity`            | `ActivityDate`   | character        | Date            | Daily       |
| `hourly_calories`           | `ActivityHour`   | character        | POSIXct         | Hourly      |
| `hourly_steps`              | `ActivityHour`   | character        | POSIXct         | Hourly      |
| `hourly_intensities`        | `ActivityHour`   | character        | POSIXct         | Hourly      |

| `minute_calories_narrow`    | `ActivityMinute` | character        | POSIXct         | Minute      |
| `minute_METS_narrow`        | `ActivityMinute` | character        | POSIXct         | Minute      |
| `heartrate_seconds_merged`  | `Time`           | character        | POSIXct         | Second      |
